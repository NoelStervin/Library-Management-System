# Library Management System

This repository contains a library management system built using MySQL for data storage. The system allows librarians to manage books, members, and borrowing activities. 

Key functionalities include:

1) Adding, editing, and deleting books with details like title, author, ISBN, and quantity.
2) Managing member information, including name, ID, and contact details.
3) Issuing books to members by recording the borrow date and due date.
4) Returning books and updating their availability status.

This system is designed to streamline library operations and improve efficiency. It provides a user-friendly interface for librarians to manage library resources and member interactions.

The following are some queries for which we can derive results using this system:

1. Retrieve the book title, category, and rental price of all available books.
2. List the employee names and their respective salaries in descending order of salary.
3. Retrieve the book titles and the corresponding customers who have issued those books.
4. Display the total count of books in each category.
5. Retrieve the employee names and their positions for the employees whose salaries are above Rs.50,000.
6. List the customer names who registered before 2022-01-01 and have not issued any books yet.
7. Display the branch numbers and the total count of employees in each branch.
8. Display the names of customers who have issued books in the month of June 2023.
9. Retrieve the book_title from the book table containing history.
10. Retrieve the branch numbers along with the count of employees for branches having more than 5 employees.

The visual representation of the code and answers for the above queries are available in the attached pdf.
